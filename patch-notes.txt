==============================

Gui:
- Removed the colour blue from the game
- Now features double the number of font formats!
- Added score and high score tracker
- Added ✮margins✮

Gameplay: 
- Movement can no longer be flipped immediately, i.e. going left to right, or up to down movements straight away
- Dying no longer makes the game close, rather, a new game starts immediately

Bugs:
- Began a workaround on fruit spawning on top of the player. The groundwork has been set but it's not working for mysterious reasons

Crashes:
- (hopefully!) Solved game randomly crashing when eating fruit. To be tested - see lines 108-109 in Snake.py

Known bugs and inefficiencies
- Movement needs to be looked at and smoothened. Current movement tick system is very yuck
- Going through the upper limit takes two movement cycles, I think - idk man I'm just a stupid uni student what do I know?
- As stated before, fruit still spawns on top of player

Areas to be implemented:
- Title screen
- 'You died! Try again?' Screen
- Skill tree

Meta elements:
- Began numbering scheme for version lists

==============================

Gui:
- Now features a PAUSE MENU! WOW! Access by pressing Escape

Bugs fixed:
- Apples no longer spawn on top of the snake (at least they shouldn't) because python is really weird and if you have a (for x in list) pattern where you're removing an element from the list every iteration, it'll check for (number of loops done == number of items) so if you remove items, you remove the number of iterations it'll do anyway thanks for listening to my Ted talk.
